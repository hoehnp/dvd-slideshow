# simple example with fades
# instead of specifying the background image on the command-line
# it's often easier to do it in this text file:
# background:duration:subtitle:image
# a duration of 0 means to set the image, but don't display it.
background:0::../images/background.jpg
# Titles are put in the center:
title:5:Simple Example:
background:1::
# The titlebar type of title has two titles, one on top and one lower:
titlebar:5:My top title:My lower title
background:1::
#  there are simple transitions that you can use:
# fadein, fadeout, crossfade, and wipe. Fadein and Fadeout will
# fade to/from whatever background you're using.  Syntax is:
# fadein:duration:subtitle
# One confusing part (new in 0.8.0) is that the transitions will
# be applied to the previous or next image, but they do not add
# additional time to the slideshow.  Examples:
# fadein:1 # this will be applied to the next real image
# fadeout:1 # this will be applied to the previous real image
# crossfade:1 	# this will overlap the last and next images by 1 second.
# You can add a subtitle during the transition, but it's optional
# use a backslash to escape a colon ':in the subtitles.
# use '\n' to force a newline (only two subtitle lines supported now).
fadein:1::
../images/picture1.jpg:5:Picture 1 is so cool\nreally it is:kenburns:57%;37%,40%;88%;49%,49%
# fadeout is similar:
# fadeout:duration:subtitle
fadeout:1:Fading out:
# it's possible to specify a new title slide in the middle of the slideshow:
fadein:1::
titlebar:5::Panoramas # note this just has the bottom title specified.
# crossfade works similar to fadein/fadeout
# crossfade:duration:subtitle
crossfade:1::
../images/pano.jpg:5:Cool panorama picture
# now let's change the background color:
# syntax is background:duration:subtitle:image
# where you can use "black" or "white"  or "#RRGGBB
# as the image name also.
background:2.5::#11a004
# or
background:2.5::black
../images/picture1.jpg:5:Picture 1 is so cool.  I can't believe how cool it really is.
# wihpe works similar to crossfade
# wipe:duration:subtitle
wipe:1::
../images/picture2.jpg:5:
# it often looks nice to end the slideshow with a fadeout to the
# background instead of just stopping the video quickly:
fadeout:1::
background:5:This is the background:
# note that the background is black now...
