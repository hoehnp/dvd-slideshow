Things to work on:

dvd-slideshow:
fuzzy edges effect?
old-picture effect?
sepiatone effect?
B&W effect?  (or should we have these effects done before?)
add image overlay function to overlay same image (logo or text?) on each image
add text overlay function to overlay text on next image.
Random Kenburns effect (done in dir2slideshow?)
themes:  wedding, vacation, etc & documentation
developer notes summarizing the crop/zoom kenburns effect stuff
different background types? (gradient, etc)
bi-linear interpolation for kenburns effect.
fadein/fadeout at same time as kenburns effect
crossfade during kenburns effects
kenburns with rotation
wrap text on titles
allow user to pass mpeg, but then we need to resample them! (use tovid?)
chapter selection menus?
Better color handling for text and such
Add text options to title slides
configuration keywords for:
	text color
	output directory
text: keyword for overlaying text anywhere on the screen
	this would use the same keywords as the kenburns effect.

dvd-menu:
setup menu with subtitle selection and/or credits, audio setup, etc.
more text control: font size and color, placement, etc.
variable non-button text on the main menu.
EXAMPLES!!!
Examples using other GUIs?
text-file input for menus
allow sub-menus.

Other:
0.7.3 examples
explain pixel aspect ratio resizing.
explain log-zoom on kenburns
better error info when things like oggdec are not found.
