Install locations according to LSB:
http://www.freestandards.org/docs/lsbbook/install-app.html

For dvd-slideshow 0.8.1, we'll install into this location:
/opt/dvd-slideshow/bin  (linked to from /usr/local/bin?)
/opt/dvd-slideshow/share/man
/opt/dvd-slideshow/share/doc
/etc/opt/dvd-slideshow/
/var/opt/dvd-slideshow/
system administrator may add links from /opt/bin to the /opt/dvd-slideshow/bin 
I figure we'll have to add a link from /usr/local/bin to
/opt/dvd-slideshow/bin/ also...

old install instructions:

First, you'll need all of the required packages in order to create
and burn a dvd:

ImageMagick > 5.5.4
Sox > 13
dvdauthor > 0.6.11
lame [required for mp3 decoding]
oggdec [required for ogg decoding]
mkisofs
dvdrtools [to actually burn dvds]
ffmpeg > 0.4.8 [ for ac3 audio ]

In order to install the dvd-slideshow package, you can copy the executables
into a bin directory in your path.  Man pages are provided in man/ and there
are also some documents in the doc/ directory.

OR

You can execute (as root):
sh install.sh

This will simply do the following:


## install some files and such:
# copy documentation:
cp man/dvd-slideshow.1 /usr/local/man/man1/.
cp man/dvd-menu.1 /usr/local/man/man1/.
cp man/dir2slideshow.1 /usr/local/man/man1/.
cp man/gallery1-to-slideshow.1 /usr/local/man/man1/.
cp man/jigl2slideshow.1 /usr/local/man/man1/.

# copy executables:
cp dvd-slideshow /usr/bin/.
cp dvd-menu /usr/bin/.
cp gallery1-to-slideshow /usr/bin/.
cp jigl2slideshow /usr/bin/.
cp dir2slideshow /usr/bin/.

remove old versions:
if [ -r "/usr/bin/gallery2slideshow" ] ; then
	echo "Removing old gallery2slideshow and installing gallery1-to-slideshow instead"
	echo "See changelog for details."
	rm "/usr/bin/gallery2slideshow"
	rm "/usr/local/man/man1/gallery2slideshow.1"
fi


Please let me know if you have any recommendations or if you are having
problems.
