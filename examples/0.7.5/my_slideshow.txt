# Examples for dvd-slideshow 0.7.5
# This example shows off some of the new features available in
# 0.7.5 through 0.7.2:

# 0.7.5: 
# new title and titlebar syntax
# different configuration variables and reading method
# Comments in all lines
# Smooth scroll effect in high-quality mode

# 0.7.3 and 0.7.2:
# Kenburns zoom velocity fix
# chapter marker keywords
# sequential audio files
# 0.001 s timing 
# using \n in subtitles to force newlines
# Subtitles stay constant between slides if the same subtitle is specified
#
# And, some older effects that aren't in the other examples:
# Copy original images into output dvd filesystem directory
# Autocrop

# First, set some variables:
debug=0 # debug
pal=0 # use ntsc mode
ac3=1 # use ac3 audio instead of mp2
copy=0 # copy all images into a directory in output dvd filesystem directory.
autocrop=0 # make images that are very near the dvd aspect ratio fill the screen.
#  Note that autocrop doesn't have an effect on portrait-orientation pictures.

#font=/usr/share/fonts/msttcorefonts/comicbd.ttf  
# NOTE that the font options are not nice now, so the syntax will probably
# change to be more flexible.  E-mail me if you have suggestions.

#toptitle_bar_height=125

#bottomtitle_font_size=36
#bottomtitle_font_color=blue  # or use hex "#RRGGBB"
#bottomtitle_bar_location_y=156 # relative to bottom of image
#bottomtitle_bar_height=55  # 0 for no 50% white behind text

# note that tenths or hundredths or thousandths of seconds can be specified:

# Just display the top title.  Lower titlebar will not show:
titlebar:2:Top Title   # add another comment if you want.
# Just show the lower title.  Top title will not show.
titlebar:2::Lower Title  

# show both titles:
toptitle_font_color=green  # change the top font color
toptitle_bar_height=0  # no white background this time.
# note that variables need to get set BEFORE the crossfade because
# crossfade actually renders the title slide in order to use it.

# now let's start playing the audio on track 1:
# If you want the audio files to play one after another, you can just put them
# one line after another and they will be concatenated...

# display a picture and set a chapter marker here.  By using the "chapter"
# keyword, you automatically set dvd-slideshow to use only your manual chapter
# markers instead of the default at each picture.

# The simple title can have \n characters to mark newlines:
title:5.72:Second part of\nmy slideshow

crossfade:2
# set another chapter marker
chapter  
pano_small.jpg:2:cool panorama picture

# zoom in to left side of panorama  (no chapter marker)

pano_small.jpg:2::crop:imageheight;left  # pause for a second

# now, the scroll effect is much smoother if you use the high-quality switch:
# -H when invoking dvd-slideshow.  It will only be smoother if your scroll
# is quite slow (moving slower than about 4 pixels per frame)
# the slower you scroll, the more you can notice the difference.

# you can force a newline in subtitles by using \n

# note, that if you specify the same subtitle for adjacent slides, the
# subtitle will stay the same now.
