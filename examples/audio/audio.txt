# Audio techniques example slideshow:
# This is an example of a "music video" cd.  My idea here
# is to be able to burn a dvd full of music for a party, and have
# it play for a long time.  While it plays, the TV displays the 
# track titles. It turns out it takes way too long to encode a music
# dvd, so this just serves as an example for how to do the audio...
title:5:My music DVD

# Audio is done just like a storyboard, where the starting point
# is determined by where it occurs in the video sequence.
# The audio file length is determined by the VIDEO sequence length.
# the format is:
# audiofile:track:effect1 effect1_params:effect2 effect2_params
# the effects are: fadein, fadeout, crossfade
# Track is the audio track number, 1 or 2.  For example, you can have
# music on track 1 (default), and then narrate (director's cut) on
# track 2. 
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1
# this starts the audio track at the same time the next picture starts.

../images/picture1.jpg:3:Picture 1
../images/picture2.jpg:5:Picture 2
# note that since the audio track is only 5 seconds long, and the two
# pictures are 7 seconds long, the audio gets buffered out with silence
# for 2 seconds.

strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1
../images/picture1.jpg:3:Picture 1
# note that even though each audio track is 5 seconds long in this example,
# the last audio track will be cropped after 3 seconds since you're
# about to pass a new audio track.

strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1

# now let's start some audio on track 2:
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:2

# if you want to display a slide with only the music info on the screen,
# use the "musictitle" keyword.  The syntax is:
# musictitle:duration:subtitle:Title;Artist;Album
# Note that you can use the special "audio" keyword in place of the
# duration.  What this does is force the duration to continue for as long
# as the last audio track plays.
musictitle:audio::TEXEMPO:Strojovna 07;Mirnix

# in order to have two audio tracks separted by a delay, use
# the "silence" audio keyword:
# silence:track
silence:1

# put in a delay image slide:
background:2::black
# note that this could just as well be a picture like:
# picture1.jpg:2:Picture 1

# Each audio file can have effects fadein or fadeout.  The default
# is fadein=0, fadeout=0 seconds.  The syntax looks like:
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1:fadein:0:fadeout:1
musictitle:audio::TEXEMPO:Strojovna 07;Mirnix

strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:2:fadein:1:fadeout:1
musictitle:audio::TEXEMPO:Strojovna 07;Mirnix (again)

strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1:fadein:1:fadeout:1
musictitle:audio::TEXEMPO:Strojovna 07;Mirnix (yet again)

# if you have a long slideshow and short audio tracks, 
# you can also add multiple audio files together in the following way:
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1:fadein:1:fadeout:1
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1:fadein:1:fadeout:1
strojovna_07 TEXEMPO-5s.ogg:1:fadein:1:fadeout:1
# and then they will all be concatenated as one audio file
# for the rest of the slideshow...
../images/picture1.jpg:8:Picture 1
../images/picture2.jpg:8:Picture 2

# you get the idea?
