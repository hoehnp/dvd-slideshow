Things to work on:

0.8.2 for release:
Update changelog for release of dvd-slideshow.
Update man pages?
Fix examples to have non-copyrighted audio.
Use stock web photos in public domain for example images.
Update themes to use freely distributable fonts!

dvd-slideshow:
fuzzy edges effect?
old-picture effect?
sepiatone effect?
B&W effect?  (or should we have these effects done before?)
add image overlay function to overlay same image (logo or text?) on each image (alpha)
developer notes summarizing the crop/zoom kenburns effect stuff
different background types? (gradient, etc)
bi-linear interpolation for kenburns effect.
kenburns with rotation (not for a while!)
wrap text on titles (has this been done?)
allow user to pass mpeg/avi/etc, but then we need to resample them! (use tovid?)
chapter selection menus?
add text overlay function to overlay text on next image.
text: keyword for overlaying text anywhere on the screen
	this would use the same keywords as the kenburns effect.

dvd-menu:  ( there will be less emphasis on dvd-menu since there are GUIs that can fill this void)
setup menu with subtitle selection and/or credits, audio setup, etc.
more text control: font size and color, placement, etc.
variable non-button text on the main menu.
EXAMPLES!!!
Examples using other GUIs?
text-file input for menus
allow sub-menus.

Other:
explain pixel aspect ratio resizing.
explain acceleration on kenburns
