# complex example with effects
# set some variables:
debug=0
# define background but don't display it:
background:0::background.jpg
# note that tenths or hundredths or thousandths of seconds can be specified:
fadein:1.582
# titlebar slides have an upper and lower title:
titlebar:5.5:Top Title:Lower Title
crossfade:1
# title slides have only one centered title:
title:5.5:My Title
fadeout:1.42
# display a picture
picture2.jpg:3.1
# there are also effects which you can use:
# scroll right/left, crop, and kenburns.
# let's go through a "crop" first, because the syntax is simpler:
# image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:x0,y0;x1,y1
# Crops the image about the coordinates specified.
# Full box description:
#   x0,y0;x1,y1
#   Specifies the top-left(0) and bottom-right(1) points.
# Keyword description:
#   frame 0%-100%;frame_location
#   where 0%-100% indicates the fraction of the final
#   dvd window width/height, and frame_location refers
#   to the CENTER POINT of the picture,
#   and can be any of the following keywords:
#  	topleft		top		topright
# 	left		middle		right
# 	bottomleft	bottom		bottomright
#    or
#  	x%,y%
# 	where % is a percentage of the window width,height
# 	starting from the top left corner of the dvd window.
#    or
#  	imagewidth | imageheight
# 	where the image width or height will be scaled to
# 	fill the full width or height of the dvd screen.
# Crop examples:
# image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:651,390;1134,759
# image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:30%;60%,60%
# image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:50%;topleft
# image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:imageheight;left
crossfade:1
picture1.jpg:2:Picture 1 cropped:crop:50%;topleft

# now let's start playing the audio on track 1:
strojovna_07-TEXEMPO-30s.ogg:1:

# kenburns is the most flexible effect:
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:start_box;end_box
# Where now we have start and end boxes, defined in
# the same way as in the "crop" function, but now
# we have two boxes defined.
# The video will then slowly morph from the start to the end, doing
# whatever cropping/zooming is necessary.  This takes a long time to
# process each frame!
# You can add a subtitle during the transition, but it's optional
# Note that to pass no subtitle, you need to use '::
# Full box description:
#  xs0,ys0;xs1,ys1;xe0,ye0;xe1,ye1
#  Specifies the top-left(0) and bottom-right(1) points.
# Keyword description:
#  start 0%-100%;start_location;end 0%-100%;end_location
# Kenburns examples:
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:651,390;1134,759;372,330;1365,1089
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:30%;60%,60%;75%;40%,50%
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:50%;topleft;50%;bottomright
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:100%;left;0,0;720,480
# image.jpg:dur:sub:kenburns:100%;left;imageheight;left
picture1.jpg:5:Wow, it's moving!:kenburns:50%;topleft;50%;middle;
# note that a fadeout gets applied to the previous picture
# while the previous picture duration stays at 5 seconds here.

# now let's start playing the audio on track 2:
# this is independent of audio track 1
strojovna_07-TEXEMPO-30s.ogg:2
fadein:1
# zoom in to left side of panorama:
pano.jpg:4::kenburns:100%;left;imageheight;left
# pano.jpg:2:pausing...:crop:imageheight;left # pause
# You can scroll across a panorama picture by using the "scroll right"
# or "scroll left" effects (up/down works also).
# This will automatically pan across the image:
# image.jpg:duration:subtitle:scroll:left
# a duration of 10 is way too fast for the image below.  Change
# it to 30 to make it look better, but it take longer to render.
pano.jpg:10:Scrolling way too fast:scroll:right
# note that crossfadfes between scroll or kenburns effects get applied
# so that it looks like they're laid on top of each other.
crossfade:1
pano.jpg:4::kenburns:imageheight;right;100%;left
# note that this is the same as the following syntax, but it's much
# easier to deal with instead of the older method:
# pano.jpg:2::crop:4610,0;5334,480
# we could do the kenburn effect backwards to zoom out, but
# I hope you get the idea...
